**Jumping Game**

Welcome to our jumping game project! This project is a simple yet entertaining game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Inspired by the popular T-Rex game found in Google Chrome, our goal is to provide you with a fun gaming experience while also demonstrating fundamental concepts of web development.

**How to Play**

To begin playing the game, simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. Once the game loads, you'll take control of our character and your objective is to help it navigate through obstacles by jumping over them. Use the spacebar key on your keyboard to make the character jump. The longer you survive and the more obstacles you overcome, the higher your score will be. How far can you go?

**Project Structure**

* HTML Structure
The index.html file lays out the foundation of our game. It defines the structure of the game canvas and incorporates essential components necessary for gameplay.

* CSS Styling
In style.css, we've meticulously crafted styles to enhance the visual appeal of our game. From the design of the game canvas to the appearance of our character and obstacles, every detail has been carefully considered to create an engaging gaming environment.

* JavaScript Logic
The magic of our game happens in script.js. Here, we've implemented the JavaScript logic responsible for controlling the game's behavior and interactions. This includes functions to handle character movement (such as jumping), obstacle generation, and collision detection to ensure a seamless gaming experience.

* Character Movement
One of the key aspects of our game is the ability for players to control the character's movement. By utilizing keyboard input, specifically the spacebar key, players can make the character jump over obstacles. Additionally, we've incorporated gravity into the game mechanics to simulate realistic jumping behavior, adding an extra layer of challenge and excitement.
